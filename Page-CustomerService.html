                                For FAA approved systems, professional software is required. Professional licensing fees are set by our software partners. While there is no such thing as "FAA approved software", our custom aircraft fleet is required for FAA approval of our various flight systems. For this reason, professional software should always be purchased directly from us. Our custom aircraft fleet is included with our professional software packages.
